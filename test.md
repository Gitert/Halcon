<p><strong>Machine Vision: Halcon</strong></p>
<p>The essentials of solving vision problems with Halcon.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>During this tutorial you will learn the essentials about machine vision using Halcon software by working on different exercises.</p>
<p>Professional industrial computer vision libraries, such as Cognex or in this case Halcon, are usually made to allow a relatively inexperienced user to write really simple image processing code. Even though this is the case it is encouraged to read through the tutorial completely. With machine vision it’s all about the details and these can make or break your application.</p>
<p><strong>Goals of this practicum</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Getting familiar with the HDevelop GUI and IDE of Halcon.</li>
<li>Being able to create a working job using the IDE.</li>
<li>Learn how to enter and extract information using Halcon.</li>
</ul>
<p>This course consists of multiple exercises. These will increase in difficulty. In the first part you will detect bottles in crates and get familiar with the GUI of Halcon. In the second part you’ll locate use-by dates on food packaging with the OCR capabilities. In the last part you’ll perform quality control on medicine packaging. There is a bonus case for learning how to deal with calibration based on the fixed world instead of on a robot-arm.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p>In order to perform this course you will need access to a computer running the HALCON software. This software is free to try out for 30 days with the evaluation license. Follow the steps below to get the software working properly on a computer with your operating system of choice.</p>
